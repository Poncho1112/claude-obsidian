# Lint Report: 2026-07-15

Scope: full filesystem scan (no Obsidian CLI on this host).

> [!done] Fixes applied 2026-07-15 (operator-approved)
> - Index header corrected (34→49 pages, 2→1 source, date → 2026-07-15) + new
>   `References` section → **orphans 2→0**.
> - `?` stripped from the 4 real `[[How does the LLM Wiki pattern work]]` wikilinks.
> - `created:` backfilled on 14 pages + full frontmatter on the tiling report →
>   **frontmatter gaps 15→0**.
> - Category E: 5 dead `related:` pointers dropped from session notes, 1 retargeted
>   ([[Karpathy LLM Wiki Pattern]]→[[LLM Wiki Pattern]]), dead canvas link removed
>   from [[overview]].
> - **Left as-is by design:** canvas/base false positives, intentional `[[Foo]]` /
>   `[[Three laws of motion]]` examples, Category C cross-plugin links.
> - **Deferred:** semantic tiling (needs ollama), [[log]] milestone backfill.

## Summary

- Pages scanned: 49 (`.md` under `wiki/`)
- Index header claims: 34 pages / 2 sources / updated 2026-04-15 — **all three stale**
- Dead wikilinks (raw): 35 across 20 targets — triaged below
- Frontmatter gaps: 14 pages missing `created` (+1 with no frontmatter)
- Orphan pages (non-meta): 2

## Core drift (the reconcile target)

The wiki content layer stopped tracking plugin dev around late April while the
plugin shipped through v1.9.2. Concrete symptoms:

1. **[[index]] header is stale.** Says `Total pages: 34 | Sources ingested: 2 |
   Last updated: 2026-04-15`. Actual: 49 pages, 1 source page in `wiki/sources/`
   (the "2" was never true against its own list). Fix: correct the header line.
2. **[[log]] is frozen at 2026-04-24.** Append-only log's top entry predates every
   v1.6.1 → v1.9.2 release. Not auto-fixable retroactively (append-only), but new
   milestone entries should resume.
3. **`wiki/references/` pages are uncatalogued and orphaned** (see Orphans).
4. **No `References` or `Folds` section in the index** despite both folders having
   content (`transport-fallback.md`, `methodology-modes.md`, `fold-k3-...`).

## Orphan Pages

- [[transport-fallback]] (`wiki/references/`): referenced only from CLAUDE.md +
  SKILL files (outside `wiki/`), nothing inside the wiki links to it. Suggest: add
  a `References` section to [[index]] and link from [[LLM Wiki Pattern]].
- [[methodology-modes]] (`wiki/references/`): same situation. Suggest: link from
  the index References section + from [[DragonScale Memory]] / a modes concept.

## Dead Links (triaged)

**A. Real, fixable now — `?` in filename mismatch (4 refs)**
- [[How does the LLM Wiki pattern work?]] → file is `How does the LLM Wiki pattern
  work.md` (no `?`; Windows disallows `?`). Referenced with the `?` from [[log]]
  and 3 others. Fix: strip the `?` from those wikilinks.

**B. False positives — link targets are canvas/base files, which exist**
- [[Wiki Map]] (6 refs) → `wiki/Wiki Map.canvas` ✓ exists
- [[dashboard.base]] (2 refs) → `wiki/meta/dashboard.base` ✓ exists
- [[claude-obsidian-presentation]] (1 ref) → `wiki/canvases/…canvas` ✓ exists
- No action. Obsidian resolves these; the flat `.md`-only scan can't.

**C. Cross-plugin links — target lives outside `wiki/` (in `skills/`, `docs/`, templates)**
- [[wiki-cli]], [[wiki-fold]] (×3), [[wiki-mode]] (×2), [[fold-template]],
  [[mcp-setup]], [[methodology-modes-guide]] (×2). These point at SKILL.md / doc /
  template files whose basenames don't match the link text, so they dead-end as
  wikilinks. Low priority (they sit in reference/fold pages describing the system).
  Fix options: convert to relative markdown links, or leave as intentional
  system-doc pointers.

**D. Intentional placeholder examples — leave as-is**
- [[Foo]], [[notes/Foo]] (×2), [[Three laws of motion]] — illustrative examples
  inside [[DragonScale Memory]] and [[Persistent Wiki Artifact]]. Flag only.

**E. Genuinely missing content pages (8 refs)**
- [[E-commerce SEO]] (×2, from [[Claude SEO]]), [[Claude Canvas]], [[Claude
  Obsidian]], [[Karpathy LLM Wiki Pattern]], [[Rankenstein]], [[wikilinks]],
  [[AI Marketing Hub Cover Images Canvas]] — mostly from the
  `2026-04-10-backlink-empire-session` note. Suggest: create stubs or drop the
  links. Needs judgement per link (some are one-off session references).

## Frontmatter Gaps

14 pages miss `created:` (mostly system/meta pages that predate the convention):
`index.md`, `log.md`, `hot.md`, `getting-started.md`, `dashboard.md`, both
`_index.md` files, and 6 `wiki/meta/` session notes. `retrieval-benchmark-v1.7.md`
also misses `tags`; `transport-fallback.md` + `methodology-modes.md` miss
`created`+`updated`/`tags`. **`tiling-report-2026-04-24.md` has no frontmatter at
all** (it's a generated report — acceptable, or add a minimal block). Safe to
backfill `created` from git first-commit dates or file mtime.

## Address Validation (DragonScale M2)

- Counter state (`.vault-meta/address-counter.txt`): 3
- Only [[DragonScale Memory]] carries `c-000001`. All other content pages predate
  the 2026-04-23 rollout baseline → **legacy, backfill not required** (informational).
- No format errors, no collisions, no counter drift observed.

## Semantic Tiling (DragonScale M3)

- Skipped: requires local ollama + `nomic-embed-text`. `obsidian`/ollama not
  provisioned on this host. Re-run `./scripts/tiling-check.py --report` where
  ollama is available.

## Recommended fix set (awaiting go)

Safe / high-value:
1. Fix [[index]] header counts + `updated` date (→ 49 pages, 1 source, 2026-07-15).
2. Add a `References` section to [[index]] listing `transport-fallback` +
   `methodology-modes` (de-orphans both).
3. Strip `?` from the 4 [[How does the LLM Wiki pattern work?]] wikilinks.

Needs your call:
4. Backfill missing `created:` frontmatter (from git/mtime).
5. Category E missing pages: create stubs vs. drop links (per-link judgement).
6. Category C cross-plugin links: convert to markdown links vs. leave.

## Follow-up scan (same day, 2026-07-15 evening)

Re-scanned `wiki/` (50 pages) via a standalone script against MCP-confirmed vault
state, cross-checked against the fixes above.

**Confirmed still clean:** orphans (0), frontmatter gaps (0 — `created`/`updated`/
`type`/`status`/`tags` all present on every page). **Dead links:** same raw set as
this report's Category B/C/D/E triage above, nothing new. No regressions.

### New finding — Address Validation gap (DragonScale M2)

This report's Address Validation section above says only [[DragonScale Memory]]
needs an address and all else is legacy/informational. That's **incomplete**: the
2026-04-23 rollout-date rule wasn't applied per-page. `.vault-meta/legacy-pages.txt`
has no entries (comments only), so classification falls purely on `created:` date.
Five pages have `created:` dates *after* 2026-04-23 and no `address:` field — under
the skill's own rule ("post-rollout without address = lint error, not
informational"), these are errors:

- [[Persistent Wiki Artifact]] — created 2026-04-24
- [[Query-Time Retrieval]] — created 2026-04-24
- [[Source-First Synthesis]] — created 2026-04-24
- [[methodology-modes]] (`wiki/references/`) — created 2026-05-17
- [[transport-fallback]] (`wiki/references/`) — created 2026-05-17

Counter state: peek = `3` (only `c-000001` in actual use on [[DragonScale Memory]];
`c-000042` on that same page is a documentation example inside a code fence, not a
real second address — no collision). No format errors, no counter drift.

Per the skill: **lint only observes, address assignment is `wiki-ingest`'s job.**
Fix path: run `./scripts/allocate-address.sh` for each of the 5 pages above and add
the returned `c-NNNNNN` to frontmatter (manually, or via a `wiki-ingest`-style pass) —
not an automated lint fix.

> [!done] Resolved 2026-07-15: addresses `c-000003`–`c-000007` assigned to the 5
> pages above. Counter now at `8`, no collisions.

### Empty-section check — unreliable, not reported

Ran a heading-adjacency check; it returned ~29 hits but nearly all are false
positives from (a) headings inside fenced code examples (e.g. [[Hot Cache]]'s
`## Recent Context` is a documentation sample inside a \`\`\`markdown block) and (b)
normal H2→H3 hierarchy with no intro prose (e.g. `# Wiki vs RAG` → `## Overview`).
Spot-checked 4 of 29; all were false positives. Not trustworthy without a real
markdown-aware parser — skipping rather than reporting noise. The two `_index.md`
placeholder "headings" ([[concepts/_index]], [[entities/_index]]) are intentional
scaffold text, not a defect either way.

### Semantic tiling — unavailable on this host

`scripts/tiling-check.py` requires `fcntl` (POSIX-only); this host's Python
(`py`, 3.14.5, Windows Store) doesn't have it, and no `python3` exists on PATH
either (the `python3` shim is a non-functional Store alias — see `wiki-cli`
transport-detection false positive noted separately). Needs WSL or a POSIX
Python to run. Not attempted.

> [!done] Resolved 2026-07-15: ran from WSL (Ollama + `nomic-embed-text`
> installed there for this). Full pair listing in
> [[tiling-report-2026-07-15]]. 50 pages scanned, 26 embedded (24 skipped:
> meta/fold/excluded filenames, 1 embed error). **2 error-band pairs**
> (>=0.90): [[Compounding Knowledge]]↔[[LLM Wiki Pattern]] and
> `claude-obsidian-ecosystem.md`↔`claude-obsidian-ecosystem-research.md`.
> 27 review-band pairs. Thresholds uncalibrated (seed defaults) — read-only,
> no auto-merge; the 2 error-band pairs are worth a manual look for overlap.

### Open items after this pass

1. ~~Address gap~~ — resolved, see above.
2. ~~Category E genuinely-missing pages~~ — already resolved prior to this pass (see [[log]]).
3. ~~Category C cross-plugin links~~ — resolved 2026-07-15: converted to full vault-path
   wikilinks with alias (e.g. `[[wiki-cli]]` → `[[skills/wiki-cli/SKILL|wiki-cli]]`) in
   transport-fallback, methodology-modes, and the fold-k3 page.
4. ~~Semantic tiling~~ — resolved, see above. 2 error-band pairs worth a
   manual look; no auto-merge performed (lint is read-only for tiling).
